These files were created:
  README is what you are currently reading
  run-once.sh runs your tests once
  run-endless.sh runs your tests endlessly via run-once.sh

Run run-endless.sh and start your kata. (On Mac/Linux you have to call ./run-endless.sh.)

Assumptions:
  - A Java JDK is installed on your system and 'java' and 'javac' are in the path.
  - junit.jar is placed in the 'lib' directory.
  - junit.jar contains JUnit 4.
  - The kata class file is generated into the 'bin' directory.
  - In the source file the classes are placed in the default package.
  - The kata source file has a main method that starts the tests.
  - If your IDE (like Eclipse) compiles the source file, you should remove the first two lines
    in the run-once.sh file.

The support for Java/JUnit was contributed by Stefan Roock.
